        "Question 1 : What is Simple Linear Regression (SLR)? Explain its purpose.\n",
        "- Simple Linear Regression (SLR) is one of the most fundamental and widely used techniques in statistics and machine learning. It is a supervised learning algorithm that is used to understand and model the relationship between two variables: one independent variable (predictor) and one dependent variable (response).\n",
        "\n",
        "In Simple Linear Regression, we assume that the relationship between the independent variable and the dependent variable can be represented by a straight line. This linear relationship helps us describe how changes in the independent variable influence the dependent variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mathematically, Simple Linear Regression is represented by the equation:\n",
        "\n",
        "y=β0​+β1​x+ε\n",
        "\n",
        "Where:\n",

        "is the error term, which captures the effect of factors not included in the model\n",
        "\n",
        "The main idea of Simple Linear Regression is to find the best-fitting straight line that minimizes the difference between the actual observed values and the values predicted by the model. This is usually achieved using the Least Squares Method, where the sum of squared errors is minimized.\n",
        "\n",
        "Purpose of Simple Linear Regression\n",
        "\n",
        "The purpose of Simple Linear Regression can be explained from multiple perspectives:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Understanding Relationship Between Variables:\n",
        "SLR helps in identifying whether there is a relationship between two variables and understanding the nature of that relationship (positive or negative). For example, it can be used to study how study hours affect exam scores.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Prediction of Future Values:\n",
        "Once the relationship is established, Simple Linear Regression can be used to predict the value of the dependent variable for a given value of the independent variable. For instance, predicting house prices based on area.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Quantifying Impact:\n",
        "The slope (\n",
        "𝛽\n",
        "1\n",
        ") provides a numerical value that explains how much the dependent variable changes when the independent variable changes by one unit. This helps in decision-making and analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Trend Analysis:\n",
        "SLR is useful in analyzing trends over time, such as sales growth, population increase, or temperature changes.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Foundation for Advanced Models:\n",
        "Simple Linear Regression forms the basis for more advanced regression techniques like Multiple Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, and Regularized Regression (Ridge, Lasso).\n",
        "\n",
        "Question 2: What are the key assumptions of Simple Linear Regression?\n",
        "- 1. Linearity\n",
        "\n",
        "The most important assumption of Simple Linear Regression is that there exists a linear relationship between the independent variable and the dependent variable. This means that the change in the dependent variable is proportional to the change in the independent variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "If the true relationship between variables is non-linear, a simple linear model will fail to capture the pattern accurately, leading to poor predictions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "If exam scores increase consistently as study hours increase, the relationship can be considered linear.\n",
        "\n",
        "- 2. Independence of Errors\n",
        "\n",
        "This assumption states that the error terms (residuals) are independent of each other. In other words, the error for one observation should not influence the error for another observation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Violation of this assumption commonly occurs in time-series data, where past values can affect future values.\n",
        "\n",
        "Why it matters:\n",
        "If errors are correlated, the model may give misleading results and unreliable statistical tests.\n",
        "\n",
        "- 3. Homoscedasticity (Constant Variance of Errors)\n",
        "\n",
        "Homoscedasticity means that the variance of the error terms remains constant across all levels of the independent variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "If the spread of residuals increases or decreases with the value of the independent variable, the data is said to have heteroscedasticity, which can reduce the efficiency of the model.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "Prediction errors for low and high values of\n",
        "x should have roughly the same spread.\n",
        "\n",
        "- 4. Normality of Errors\n",
        "\n",
        "This assumption states that the error terms are normally distributed with a mean of zero. While the regression model can still work without perfect normality, this assumption is important for:\n",

        "Note:\n",
        "Normality is more critical for inference than for prediction.\n",
        "\n",
        "- 5. No Multicollinearity (Trivial in SLR)\n",
        "\n",
        "In Simple Linear Regression, only one independent variable is used, so multicollinearity is not a practical concern. However, conceptually, it assumes that the independent variable is not influenced by another hidden variable that strongly affects the dependent variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "- 6. Zero Mean of Errors\n",
        "\n",
        "The average value of the error term is assumed to be zero. This means the model does not consistently overestimate or underestimate the dependent variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "- 7. No Extreme Outliers\n",
        "\n",
        "Although not always listed as a formal assumption, Simple Linear Regression assumes that the data does not contain extreme outliers that can disproportionately influence the regression line.\n",
        "\n",
